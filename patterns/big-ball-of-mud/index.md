# Big Ball of Mud

The big ball of mud is not in any category because it is not an architectural pattern. It is, rather, the complete absence of architecture in a software system. It deserves mentioning because it could still be argued to be an architectural style, and it is also very common out in the wild, probably more so than we care to admit. It has many severe drawbacks but it is nonetheless not wholly without virtue, and it is instructive to know the forces that drive software systems into this state.
