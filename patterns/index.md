Architectural designs in software do not need to be invented from scratch for every system, there are by now a number of different architectural patterns that are widely known. These patterns are similar in concept to the better known Gang of Four design patterns in that they are generalised designs that can be applied to software systems to solve common classes of programming problems. The differences are that Gang of Four-style design patterns are intended to be implemented in object-oriented programming languages in particular, and the programming problems they solve are very specific: they are just not domain specific. By contrast, architectural patterns are not OO designs, they can be implemented in any programming language, the types of problem they solve are more general, and they lend shape to the whole system: a system cannot be refactored away from an architectural pattern without substantially re-implementing it.
